# Smart NPCs

Objective : connect a multiplayer unity game to a genAI model using an API. The model will provide NPCs reactions according to a certain context.

# Game

The game is built to work with a dedicated server, using a host (server + client) support is not garanteed.

## Usage

- Download the latest version
- Run the executable and **connect as a server**
- Run as many other instances as you like and **connect as a client**

Closing the server will disconnect every client.
Closing a client will only disconnect it and won't impact other clients directly.

### Controls

Use directional arrows to move, use B to enable/disable the build mode.

#### 1- Normal mode

Move the player/camera using directional arrows.

#### 2- Build mode

Enable/Disable build mode with B.
Objects can be built with left click.
